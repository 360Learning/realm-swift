The Migration project shows several examples of migrations and migration blocks.

The purpose of this example is to provide a more in depth view of certain problems and pitfalls users might
face when migrations get more complex and the number of versions increases.

How to use the example:
You can build and run the project since this is the default state (see
`shouldCreateExamples` in `AppDelegate`).
There is nothing much so see in terms of unit tests, console log or in the app itself.
If there is no error the migration was successful.
The files to look at are located in the `Examples` folder. Every file contains an extract
of everything necessary for this version (schema version, objects, migration).

How to create new examples:
- Set `shouldCreateExamples` in `AppDelegate` to true.
- Duplicate the most recent `Example_vx`.
- Comment out the previous one. Update the current one:
  - Add a new version to the `RealmVersion` enum.
  - Update the `Object` definitions according to your new example.
  - Update the migration block.
  - Create some examples for that specific schema version (they will be used in later schema version).
- Run the app.
- The realm file (path printed to console) created by this run must then be added to project.

Important notes:
- Code in all `Example_vx` files except the most recent one needs to be commented out to avoid
  name conflicts of already defined types.
- The migration block is repeated in each `RealmFile_vx` since some parts of older migrations might
  change over time as well when tables or properties get renamed or their internal structure changes.
