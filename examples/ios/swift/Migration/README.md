# Migration Examples

The Migration project shows several examples of migrations and migration blocks.

The purpose of this example is to provide a more in depth view of certain problems and pitfalls users might face when 
migrations get more complex and the number of versions increases.

## How to use the example

You can build and run the project since this is the default state (the `Migration.xcconfig` is only used to create new examples).

The files to look at are located in the `Examples` folder. Every file contains an extract of everything necessary for
this version (schema version, objects, migration and migration checks).
